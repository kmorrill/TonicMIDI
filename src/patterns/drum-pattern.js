/**
 * DrumPattern is a Pattern class that automatically generates "low", "medium",
 * and "high" intensity versions of a specified drum pattern. By default, it
 * uses the "medium" version, but it can adapt to "low" or "high" when
 * orchestrated by an EnergyManager (or via a manual method call).
 *
 * ### Example Usage
 * ```js
 * import { DrumPattern } from "op-xy-live/patterns/drum-pattern.js";
 *
 * // The pattern is an object where each key is a "drum part" (e.g. "kick", "snare"),
 * // and each value is an array of 0/1 indicating hits. Each array should have
 * // 'patternLength' steps. (1 = hit, 0 = no hit)
 * const mediumDrums = {
 *   kick:  [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
 *   snare: [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1, 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
 *   hat:   [1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1, 1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]
 * };
 *
 * // drumMap optionally translates part names to MIDI note names (or any note naming system).
 * // If not provided, the code will fall back to "C3" for unspecified drums.
 * const drumMap = {
 *   kick: "C2",
 *   snare: "D2",
 *   hat: "F#2"
 * };
 *
 * // Create a DrumPattern that has "low", "medium", and "high" variants
 * // automatically derived from 'mediumDrums'.
 * const drumPattern = new DrumPattern({
 *   mediumPattern: mediumDrums,
 *   drumMap,
 *   patternLength: 16
 * });
 * ```
 */

  /**
   * Creates a new DrumPattern with automatic "low", "medium", and "high" variants

   *
   * @param {Object} options
   * @param {Record<string, number[]>} options.mediumPattern
   *   An object whose keys are drum part names (e.g. "kick", "snare") and
   *   whose values are arrays of length `patternLength`. Each array element is
   *   either 0 (no hit) or 1 (hit). This serves as the baseline "medium" pattern.
   * @param {Record<string, string>} [options.drumMap={}]
   *   A map from drum part names (e.g. "kick", "snare") to note names (e.g. "C3").
   *   When a hit occurs on a given part, the corresponding note will be used.
   *   Defaults to an empty object, which means unspecified parts fall back to "C3".
   * @param {number} [options.patternLength=16]
   *   The total number of steps in each of the pattern arrays. Must match the length
   *   of the arrays in `mediumPattern`.
